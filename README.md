# YTMdload

## Deprecation warning
This project has been replaced by my new remake: [YTMusicDL](https://github.com/RaduTek/YTMusicDL).

This version will not be maintained and its use is not recommended.

## Description

App to download songs from YT Music using the metadata available from YT Music

Using yt_dlp, ytmusicapi and music_tag projects

Downloads individual songs, playlists and albums (by browse ID or playlist ID)
Just need to paste the URLs to the command line

For the moment, configuration is in the `ytmdload.py` file (starts at line 34).
